# MovieMarathon

Made by David de Alencar.

## Overview

This is [MovieMarathon](https://moviemarathon-alencar.netlify.app/)! A web application that empowers users to curate and organize personalized film marathons.

## Movivation

As a movie enthusiast, I desired a tool that would enable me to select a theme based on a genre, date, or just a vibe, choose a set of movies that fit that theme, and then rate the movies â€” not based on how good or bad I think they are, but on how much fun I had watching them and how well they fit into the marathon. So, I built [MovieMarathon](https://moviemarathon-alencar.netlify.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Additional Tools:** TailwindCSS, FramerMotion, ReactRouter, ReactQuery(TanstackQuery), Supabase, Netlify.
